Going to diamond city there i also see no winning faction or institute victory comments from the companions. I have uninstalled vortex several times, uninstalled the mod diamond textures cbbe v2 several times. When players destroy the brotherhood on the railroad side. I think this mod is better than any dlc we see at the game. It's the only mod i have added so far so it's not a conflict issue. Hello all.i was hoping someone could help me as i'm currently playing fallout 4 and my character is now outside diamond city but cannot enter as the screen says the big. It doesn't seem to affect them all, some are wearing white.</p>
